## Testing
- When you look at a test, ask yourself: "Can this test actually fail if the real code is broken?" Or is it just passing because it's testing fake/mocked behavior that doesnâ€™t reflect the real logic?
- Avoid writing tests that just confirm behavior guaranteed by the language, the standard library, or obvious code that can't really fail unless the environment is broken.
