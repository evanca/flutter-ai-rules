# Flutter Rules for Windsurf, Cursor, and Other AI-Powered IDEs

## üöÄ Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive, (almost) non-opinionated collection of Flutter-related rules tailored for use with **Windsurf**, **Cursor**, and other AI-powered IDEs. These rules are designed to improve your development workflow, ensure consistency, and help you get the most out of your AI coding assistant.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`rules/`**  
  Contains individual rule files, each focused on a specific topic or tool (e.g., `bloc.md`, `effective_dart.md`, etc.).  
  These files are:
    - Based **only** on official documentation from Flutter, Dart, or relevant package websites.
    - Categorized by subject to make them easy to mix, match, and reference.
    - Meant to be refined, adjusted, or extracted based on your project needs.

- **`combined/`**  
  Contains pre-made, curated sets of rules that combine commonly used topics (e.g., Flutter + Riverpod + Mockito).  
  These files:
    - Are kept under **6,000 characters** to comply with **Windsurf's** limit.
    - Can be used **as-is** by copying them into your global or local rules configuration.

## ‚úÖ How To Use

### Option 1: Use Pre-Made Combined Rules

If you want a quick setup:

1. Browse the [`combined/`](./combined) folder.
2. Copy a file that suits your project.
3. Paste it into your IDE's global or local rules config.
4. You're ready to go.

### Option 2: Use Individual Rule Files

If you prefer more control:

1. Browse the [`rules/`](./rules) folder.
2. Pick files relevant to your project (e.g., `riverpod.md`, `bloc.md`, etc.).
3. You can:
    - **Include** them directly in your IDE setup.
    - **Reference** them in prompts to add context.
    - **Extract** only the parts that are useful for your context.
    - **Include** them partially or fully in a PRD (Product Requirements Document).

Everything is modular ‚Äî use what works best for you.

## üìè No Opinions, Just Documentation

All rules are sourced from official documentation ‚Äî no personal preferences or subjective interpretations. That‚Äôs intentional. You‚Äôre free to alter them to your taste, but this repo keeps things objective by sticking to the source.

Note: This might sometimes lead to contradictory rules (e.g., if one package suggests one folder architecture and another recommends a different one).

## üìå Use Cases

- Set up global rules for a Flutter project in your IDE.
- Configure project-specific constraints for popular state management packages.
- Provide clear expectations in a PDR when working with a team.
- Extract only what you need to avoid rule clutter.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to suggest a new rule or improve an existing one, here‚Äôs how you can help:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add or modify rules in the appropriate folder.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear explanation of your changes.  
   **Make sure to include an official documentation link** for any rule set you‚Äôre adding or modifying to keep everything objective and reliable.
